# My Web Development Journey

**Greetings! Hello, World!** 

My name is Jake and this is my personal documentation about how I explore the world of web development!

## What is This All About?

I have decided to make a digital diary about this journey as I suddenly had an urge to create one!

Jokes! Kidding aside, this journey started when I became a web development volunteeer in a Google Developer Student Clubs in my university, at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Being in GDSC ignited the fire in me to pursue and try web development. With that, I wanted to see how will I grow in this field by making a documentation.

## About Me 

Currently, I'm in a web development bootcamp program in GDSC. Here, we learn, explore, and develop web projects. Our first project where we developed a website using vanilla HTML,CSS, and JavaScript is the main reason why I started documenting my progress.

The project did not end well. However, it inspired me to learn new things and deep dive into the rabbit hole of web development!
